# Provisioning the CA and Generating TLS Certificates

As I mentioned on the Readme of this repository, I am using *openssl* tool to create the needed TLS certificates, because the openssl is included in the Ubuntu OS by default, so, no needs to install the cfssl and cfssljson tools, and in addition, the benefit to know another option when creating the certificates.
